I am working on -2(4+x) =8. I got it to -8+2x=8, but I'm not sure what to do next.

First, let's correct the initial mistake in the given answer. The original equation was $-2(4+x)=8$. When we distribute the $-2$ to both $4$ and $x$, it becomes $-8-2x=8$. 

Next, we want to isolate the variable $x$ on one side of the equation. To do this, we can add $8$ to both sides of the equation to get rid of the $-8$ on the left side. This gives us $-2x=8+8$, which simplifies to $-2x=16$.

Then, to solve for $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by $-2$. This gives us $x=\frac{16}{-2}$, which simplifies to $x=-8$.

So, the solution to the equation $-2(4+x)=8$ is $x=-8$. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be $\boxed{-8}$.

The answer is: -8.
