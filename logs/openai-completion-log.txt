Needed a nice lamp for my bedroom, and this one had additional storage and not too high of a price point. Got it fast.  The string to our lamp broke during the transit and the company happily sent over a new one. Came within a few days as well. It was easy to put together.  I had a missing part, so I contacted their support and they very quickly got me the missing piece! Lumina seems to me to be a great company that cares about their customers and products!!

Article: '''
Last Saturday, my five-year-old son asked me “Can we make our own video game?” He asks a lot of “Can we make out own…” questions, and the practical answer is usually no. But I felt uniquely qualified to help with this one, so I said “Sure!”

I turned to Kaboom.js, “a Javascript game programming library that helps you make games fast and fun.” I had some previous experience playing around with it in 2019 and knew that it would be a good option for what he wanted to build. Between the Kaboom playground and the Kaboom template on Replit, it was really easy to get started building the game.

That said, we quickly outgrew online dev environments and wanted to move local. I created a new directory, npm inited, and then installed kaboom. I imported the library from an .html file, opened it with Live Server, and we were off to the races. With this setup, we worked on the game Saturday and after work a few days this week.

The big takeaway from one week of development is that making games is hard! Even a Mario-clone is a complex application with a lot of conditions to manage and interactions to handle. Kaboom makes it easy, but it still takes a lot of time to build. I wish there were more examples in the Kaboom documentation; I’ve found a lot of detailed but outdated tutorials online and it’s hard to sift through what still works and what depends on old APIs.

But more importantly, building the game has meant a lot of quality time with my kids. Although the project started with my older son and me, we where quickly joined by my three-year-old son. Both boys really enjoy working on the game together, even though most of the time is spent with me reading the documentation and debugging issues. But doing it with them on my lap is a wonderful experience. I’m looking forward to building more with them as they grow.

If you are interested in making a game with your kids or nieces/nephews or students, here are some recommendations:

Involve your kids as much as possible in designing the game: Let their imagination run wild, and then figure out how to make it a reality later. If they’re stuck, guide them through the brainstorming process, and have paper and pencils handy for their designs.
Make small, incremental, and visible changes: It can be really tempting when you’re working in a new library to refactor old code when you learn new things. But for the sake of the kids, make sure to have something different about the game that they can see after each session. And give them lots of chances to play the game during and after coding.
Use Kaboom’s types when you’re developing: Kaboom adds a ton of global functions, and it is challenging to learn what they are and how to use them. Thankfully, the library includes type definitions that help with this. A bundler like Vite would probably bring in those types automatically, but if you (like me) want to keep things simple you can import the types with a JSDoc @typedef comment like this:
/** @typedef { import("./node_modules/kaboom/dist/global") } */
import kaboom from "./node_modules/kaboom/dist/kaboom.mjs";
When the game is in a more finished state, I’ll be happy to share it. But in the meantime, I’m just going to enjoy the opportunity to use my talents to spend extra time with my sons.

I imported the library from an .html file, opened it with Live Server, and we were off to the races. With this setup, we worked on the game Saturday and after work a few days this week.

The big takeaway from one week of development is that making games is hard! Even a Mario-clone is a complex application with a lot of conditions to manage and interactions to handle. Kaboom makes it easy, but it still takes a lot of time to build. I wish there were more examples in the Kaboom documentation; I’ve found a lot of detailed but outdated tutorials online and it’s hard to sift through what still works and what depends on old APIs.

But more importantly, building the game has meant a lot of quality time with my kids. Although the project started with my older son and me, we where quickly joined by my three-year-old son. Both boys really enjoy working on the game together, even though most of the time is spent with me reading the documentation and debugging issues. But doing it with them on my lap is a wonderful experience. I’m looking forward to building more with them as they grow.

If you are interested in making a game with your kids or nieces/nephews or students, here are some recommendations:

Involve your kids as much as possible in designing the game: Let their imagination run wild, and then figure out how to make it a reality later. If they’re stuck, guide them through the brainstorming process, and have paper and pencils handy for their designs.
Make small, incremental, and visible changes: It can be really tempting when you’re working in a new library to refactor old code when you learn new things. But for the sake of the kids, make sure to have something different about the game that they can see after each session. And give them lots of chances to play the game during and after coding.
Use Kaboom’s types when you’re developing: Kaboom adds a ton of global functions, and it is challenging to learn what they are and how to use them. Thankfully, the library includes type definitions that help with this. A bundler like Vite would probably bring in those types automatically, but if you (like me) want to keep things simple you can import the types with a JSDoc @typedef comment like this:
/** @typedef { import("./node_modules/kaboom/dist/global") } */
import kaboom from "./node_modules/kaboom/dist/kaboom.mjs";
When the game is in a more finished state, I’ll be happy to share it. But in the meantime, I’m just going to enjoy the opportunity to use my talents to spend extra time with my sons.

Last Saturday, my five-year-old son asked me “Can we make our own video game?” He asks a lot of “Can we make out own…” questions, and the practical answer is usually no. But I felt uniquely qualified to help with this one, so I said “Sure!”

I turned to Kaboom.js, “a Javascript game programming library that helps you make games fast and fun.” I had some previous experience playing around with it in 2019 and knew that it would be a good option for what he wanted to build.

That said, we quickly outgrew online dev environments and wanted to move local. I created a new directory, npm inited, and then installed kaboom. I imported the library from an .html file, opened it with Live Server, and we were off to the races. With this setup, we worked on the game Saturday and after work a few days this week.

The big takeaway from one week of development is that making games is hard! Even a Mario-clone is a complex application with a lot of conditions to manage and interactions to handle. Kaboom makes it easy, but it still takes a lot of time to build. I wish there were more examples in the Kaboom documentation; I’ve found a lot of detailed but outdated tutorials online and it’s hard to sift through what still works and what depends on old APIs.

But more importantly, building the game has meant a lot of quality time with my kids. Although the project started with my older son and me, we where quickly joined by my three-year-old son. Both boys really enjoy working on the game together, even though most of the time is spent with me reading the documentation and debugging issues. But doing it with them on my lap is a wonderful experience. I’m looking forward to building more with them as they grow.

If you are interested in making a game with your kids or nieces/nephews or students, here are some recommendations:

Involve your kids as much as possible in designing the game: Let their imagination run wild, and then figure out how to make it a reality later. If they’re stuck, guide them through the brainstorming process, and have paper and pencils handy for their designs.
Make small, incremental, and visible changes: It can be really tempting when you’re working in a new library to refactor old code when you learn new things. But for the sake of the kids, make sure to have something different about the game that they can see after each session. And give them lots of chances to play the game during and after coding.
Use Kaboom’s types when you’re developing: Kaboom adds a ton of global functions, and it is challenging to learn what they are and how to use them. Thankfully, the library includes type definitions that help with this. A bundler like Vite would probably bring in those types automatically, but if you (like me) want to keep things simple you can import the types with a JSDoc @typedef comment like this:
/** @typedef { import("./node_modules/kaboom/dist/global") } */
import kaboom from "./node_modules/kaboom/dist/kaboom.mjs";
When the game is in a more finished state, I’ll be happy to share it. But in the meantime, I’m just going to enjoy the opportunity to use my talents to spend extra time with my sons.

Last Saturday, my five-year-old son asked me “Can we make our own video game?” He asks a lot of “Can we make out own…” questions, and the practical answer is usually no. But I felt uniquely qualified to help with this one, so I said “Sure!”

I turned to Kaboom.js, “a Javascript game programming library that helps you make games fast and fun.” I had some previous experience playing around with it in 2019 and knew that it would be a good option for what he wanted to build.

I am working on -2(4+x) =8. I got it to -8+2x=8, but I'm not sure what to do next

completion:  To solve the equation -2(4 + x) = 8, first distribute the -2 on the left side of the equation:

-2 * 4 + -2 * x = 8

This simplifies to:

-8 + -2x = 8

Now, to get all the variable terms on one side and the constants on the other side, you need to move the constant term -8 to the right side of the equation and change its sign. Also, move the term with x to the left side and change its sign as well:

-2x = 16

Finally, divide both sides by -2 to get x:

x = -8

So, the solution to the equation is x = -8.

Solve the problem and output the answer only.

completion:  To solve the equation -8 + 2x = 8, first subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with x:

2x = -4

Next, divide both sides by 2 to get x:

x = -2

So, the solution is x = -2.

completion:  To solve the equation -2(4 + x) = 8 for x, first isolate the term with x on one side of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Distribute the negative sign to both terms inside the parentheses: -2 * 4 + (-2) * x = 8
2. Simplify each term: -8 + 2x = 8
3. Now, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get all the terms on the left side: 2x = 0
4. Finally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for x: x = 0

So, the solution to the equation -2(4 + x) = 8 is x = 0.

You are a math tutor who understands the importance of showing your work.

You are helping a student with their homework.

Student: I am working on -2(4+x) =8. I got it to -8+2x=8, but I'm not sure what to do next.

completion:  I see that you have distributed the negative sign in the parentheses and brought out the constant term to the left side of the equation. Now we need to isolate the variable x on one side of the equation. Let's follow these steps:

1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get -2(4+x) = -8.
2. Add 2x to both sides of the equation to get -2(4+x) + 2x = -8 + 2x.
3. Distribute the negative sign in the parentheses to get -2(4) - 2(x) + 2x = -8 + 2x.
4. Simplify the left side of the equation by evaluating the constant term: -8 is not equal to -2 * 4, so there's an error in your initial steps. The correct distribution should be: -2(4) = -8 and x = 0 (since the x term drops out). However, since you have x as a variable, let's continue with the given equation.
5. Simplify further by factoring out a common term of 2x from both sides: 2x(-2(4+x) + 1) = -8 + 2x.
6. Distribute the 2x inside the parentheses: 2x(-2*4-2*x+1) = -8+2x.
7. Simplify: 2x(-8-2x+1) = -8+2x.
8. Distribute the negative sign outside the parentheses: 2x(-8-2x+1) = -8+2x.
9. Factor out a common term of -2x from both sides: 2x(-8-2x+1) = 2x(-4-x).
10. Divide both sides by -2 to isolate x: x = (4-x)/2.
11. Solve for x by subtracting x from both sides and then multiplying both sides by 2: x = 2 - x => 3x = 2 => x = 2/3.

So, the solution to the equation is x = 2/3. Remember that this equation has only one solution since it's a linear equation.
